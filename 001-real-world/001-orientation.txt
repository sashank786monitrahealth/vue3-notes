In this, VM course - we will be building production level app using Vue 3. We'll start off by creating the project using the VueCLI. Then we will learn about single file .vue components and how they can be used to create a single page application. We'll cover the fundamentals of Vue Router so we can navigate between the different views of our app, and we'll even fetch real external data using API calls with Axios. We'll end by learning about the build process and how to deploy our app in production.
